		<h1>Good and Bad Websites</h1>
	<p>Here are two examples of websites that I consider to be good and bad. </p>
			
			<h2>Good Site</h2>
			
		
			<h2>Nasty Gal</h2>
			<p><img src="nastygalsite.jpg"></p>
			<p>This site is simple and clean and presents the viewer with a large picture. 
				Rather than cluttering the home page with lots of info, the tags are hidden 
				under buttons. </p>
			
			
			
		
			<h1>Bad Site<h1>
		
			<h2>Lings Cars</h2>
			
		
			
		
 			<p><img src="lingscars.jpg"</a></p>
 			<p> This site is cluttered, hard to navigate and overwhelming. I have no idea what is 
 				going on. </p>
